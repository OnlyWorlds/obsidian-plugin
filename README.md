OnlyWorlds is a framework for creating, building, sharing, and simulating worlds.

## Configuring Hotkeys

This plugin requires a custom hotkey to link element fields

Suggestion: CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + L

To set up:
1. Open Obsidian
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Hotkeys`
3. Search for "Link Elements"
4. Click on the + symbol, then input a combination
 
## Getting Started 

Use the Create World command (Ctrl + P)

If necessary folders and/or files are missing, this command will automatically import and create them

A folder 'OnlyWorlds' will be created at the top of your vault. As of release 1.0.2, this folder must remain at the top of your vault for the plugin to function

Use Create Element to fill your world with elements of [various categories](https://onlyworlds.github.io/docs/framework/categories.html)

Integrate existing world content, or create new content, by shaping elements through their attribute fields. Join community [discussions](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/discussions) on improving field definitions

Convert your worlds into a JSON data file by using the 'Copy World' command, or export it to OnlyWorlds.com using the 'Export World' command

## Element Editing
- **Normal fields**: Accept text of any length

### Editing Guidelines
- The **Name** field of an element must match the note name
- Each element must have a unique Id, generated automatically with **Create Element** command. When duplicating manually, ensure to generate a [new UUIDv7](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version7)

## Settings 
- Write the **active world** name for ongoing work 
- Enable 18 category-specific commands for creating elements
