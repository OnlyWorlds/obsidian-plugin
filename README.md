# OnlyWorlds Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin provides complete workflows for world creation, building, and management, fully compatible with the [OnlyWorlds](https://www.onlyworlds.com) framework.

It functions as a standalone tool for organizing worlds, and facilitates the transfer of these worlds across various other tools and games.

## OnlyWorlds

OnlyWorlds is a framework for creating, building, sharing, and simulating worlds.

It has been in closed alpha release since early 2024. Full release is planned for late summer 2025.  

Full information in this [technical documentation](https://onlyworlds.github.io/).
 
 ## Configuring Hotkeys

This plugin requires a custom hotkey to link element fields

Suggestion: CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + L

To set up:
1. Open Obsidian
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Hotkeys`
3. Search for "Link Elements"
4. Click on the + symbol, then input a combination
 
## Getting Started 

Use the Create World command (Ctrl + P)

If necessary folders and/or files are missing, this command will automatically import and create them

A folder 'OnlyWorlds' will be created at the top of your vault. As of release 1.0.2, this folder must remain at the top of your vault for the plugin to function

Use the Create Element command to fill your world with elements of [various categories](https://onlyworlds.github.io/docs/framework/categories.html)

OnlyWorlds are shaped primarily through elements and their attribute fields. Join community [discussions](https://github.com/OnlyWorlds/OnlyWorlds/discussions) to discuss how to impove these field definitions.

Convert your worlds into a JSON data file by using the 'Copy World' command, or export it to OnlyWorlds.com using the 'Export World' command

## Element Editing

### Editing Guidelines
- The **Name** field of an element must match the note name
- Each element must have a unique Id, generated automatically with **Create Element** command. When duplicating manually, ensure to generate a [new UUIDv7](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version7)

## Settings 
- Write the **active world** name for ongoing work 
- Enable 18 category-specific commands for creating elements
- Set the default category for creating new elements
